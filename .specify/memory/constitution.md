# AI/Spec book + RAG chatbot on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
All content and code MUST adhere to technical accuracy in the domains of ROS 2, Isaac, Gazebo, and Unity. Claims and simulations MUST be verifiable and grounded in established principles.

### Clarity for Engineering Students
Content and explanations MUST be clear, structured, and easily understandable for engineering students. Consistent terminology (VLA, SLAM, Nav2) MUST be used throughout.

### Spec-Driven Development & Traceability
All content, code, and RAG answers MUST be traceable to defined specifications and primary sources. The project MUST maintain a clear, structured learning flow.

### Reproducibility & Clean Code
All code and simulation examples MUST be reproducible in a clean environment. Diagrams MUST accurately match real robot architectures.

### Grounded RAG Answers & Citation
RAG answers MUST be based *only* on book content, cite section/page (IEEE style), and allow for "Not in book" responses. A minimum of 60% of primary documentation from ROS2/Isaac/Gazebo/Unity/OpenAI MUST be used as sources.

### Ethics & Safety
Development MUST prioritize simulation-first and safe robotics guidance.

## Constraints & Standards

- Book: 25k–40k words, Docusaurus format.
- Modules: ROS2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac, VLA, Capstone.
- Delivery: GitHub Pages deployment + repository.
- Standards: Official documentation and academic papers as primary sources.

## Success Criteria

- Claims verifiable.
- Running simulation examples.
- Stable RAG chatbot embedded in the book.
- Low-latency RAG answers.
- Clear, structured learning flow.

## Governance

- The constitution supersedes all other practices.
- Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
- All PRs/reviews MUST verify compliance.
- Complexity MUST be justified.
