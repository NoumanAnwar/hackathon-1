Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Target audience: Students learning humanoid robot control using ROS 2 Focus: Core ROS 2 concepts enabling AI → robot actions (nodes, topics, services, rclpy, URDF) Success criteria: - Explains ROS 2 graph clearly - Shows Python agent → ROS controller flow - Demonstrates URDF structure for humanoids - Includes 1 runnable pub/sub example - All claims backed by official ROS 2 sources Constraints: - Format: Markdown (Docusaurus) - Style: IEEE citations - Word count: ~6,000 total (2k/chapter) - Sources: Official docs + 2 academic refs - Timeline: 1 week Not building: - Full OS setup guides - Hardware motor control - ROS 2 C++ deep dive Chapters: Chapter 1: ROS 2 Graph Basics - Nodes, Topics, Services - Message flow + workspace structure Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy - Agent → controller bridge - Simple pub/sub + service call Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids - URDF structure (links/joints) - Visualizing + exporting for simulation
