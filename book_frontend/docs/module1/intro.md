# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System! This module focuses on the fundamental middleware for robot control - ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). ROS 2 provides the essential communication infrastructure that allows different components of a robotic system to interact seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Implement Python agents that communicate via ROS 2 using rclpy
- Describe robot structures using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Connect AI systems to physical robot controllers

## Module Structure

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Graph Basics - Nodes, Topics, Services
- **Chapter 2**: Python Agents with rclpy - Building ROS 2 Nodes
- **Chapter 3**: URDF for Humanoids - Robot Description Format

## Key Concepts

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the "nervous system" of a robot, providing a framework for:
- Process communication through topics and services
- Device drivers for sensors and actuators
- Hardware abstraction and message passing
- Package management and build systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Real-World Applications

ROS 2 is used extensively in:
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial robots
- Research platforms
- Humanoid robotics applications
