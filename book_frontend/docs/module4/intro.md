# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)! This module explores the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics. We'll bridge the gap between natural language understanding and robotic action, enabling robots to comprehend voice commands and execute complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper for voice commands
- Apply cognitive planning using LLMs to translate natural language to robotic actions
- Develop Vision-Language-Action pipelines for complex robotic tasks
- Execute the capstone project: autonomous humanoid navigation and manipulation

## Module Structure

- **Chapter 1**: Voice-to-Action - OpenAI Whisper and Speech Recognition
- **Chapter 2**: Cognitive Planning - LLM Integration for Natural Language Processing
- **Chapter 3**: Capstone Project - The Autonomous Humanoid

## Key Concepts

Vision-Language-Action systems integrate:
- Natural language understanding and processing
- Computer vision for object detection and recognition
- Motion planning and execution
- Multi-modal AI coordination

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of all previous modules
- Knowledge of AI and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with LLM APIs and integration
- Understanding of computer vision fundamentals

## Real-World Applications

VLA systems power:
- Household robotics assistants
- Voice-controlled service robots
- Industrial automation with natural interfaces
- Assistive robotics for elderly and disabled individuals

## Capstone Project

The module culminates in the "Autonomous Humanoid" capstone project, where students implement a system that:
- Receives voice commands using OpenAI Whisper
- Plans paths using Nav2 navigation stack
- Identifies objects using computer vision
- Manipulates objects using ROS 2 control
