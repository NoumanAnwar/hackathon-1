This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of the ROS 2 graph, which forms the backbone of communication in a ROS 2 system. Understanding these basics is crucial for developing any robotics application with ROS 2.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"chapter2":{"id":"chapter2","title":"Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy","description":"In Chapter 1, we learned about the theoretical concepts of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services. Now, we'll put that knowledge into practice by implementing simple Python nodes using rclpy, the ROS 2 client library for Python. We will create a publisher (talker) and a subscriber (listener) to demonstrate inter-node communication.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"},"chapter3":{"id":"chapter3","title":"Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids","description":"In the previous chapters, we explored the ROS 2 communication graph and implemented simple Python nodes. Now, we shift our focus to representing the physical structure of a robot using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). URDF is an XML format used in ROS to describe all aspects of a robot, including its geometry, kinematics, and dynamics. It's crucial for visualization in tools like RViz2 and for physics simulation.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}}
