This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of the ROS 2 graph, which forms the backbone of communication in a ROS 2 system. Understanding these basics is crucial for developing any robotics application with ROS 2.","source":"@site/docs/chapter1.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/chapter1","permalink":"/docs/chapter1","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/main/book_frontend/docs/chapter1.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":1,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":1},"sidebar":"defaultSidebar","next":{"title":"Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy","permalink":"/docs/chapter2"}},{"id":"chapter2","title":"Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy","description":"In Chapter 1, we learned about the theoretical concepts of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services. Now, we'll put that knowledge into practice by implementing simple Python nodes using rclpy, the ROS 2 client library for Python. We will create a publisher (talker) and a subscriber (listener) to demonstrate inter-node communication.","source":"@site/docs/chapter2.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/chapter2","permalink":"/docs/chapter2","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/main/book_frontend/docs/chapter2.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":2,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":2},"sidebar":"defaultSidebar","previous":{"title":"Chapter 1: ROS 2 Graph Basics - Nodes, Topics, Services","permalink":"/docs/chapter1"},"next":{"title":"Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids","permalink":"/docs/chapter3"}},{"id":"chapter3","title":"Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids","description":"In the previous chapters, we explored the ROS 2 communication graph and implemented simple Python nodes. Now, we shift our focus to representing the physical structure of a robot using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). URDF is an XML format used in ROS to describe all aspects of a robot, including its geometry, kinematics, and dynamics. It's crucial for visualization in tools like RViz2 and for physics simulation.","source":"@site/docs/chapter3.md","sourceDirName":".","slug":"/chapter3","permalink":"/docs/chapter3","draft":false,"unlisted":false,"editUrl":"https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/tree/main/book_frontend/docs/chapter3.md","tags":[],"version":"current","sidebarPosition":3,"frontMatter":{"sidebar_position":3},"sidebar":"defaultSidebar","previous":{"title":"Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy","permalink":"/docs/chapter2"}}],"drafts":[],"sidebars":{"defaultSidebar":[{"type":"doc","id":"chapter1"},{"type":"doc","id":"chapter2"},{"type":"doc","id":"chapter3"}]}}]}},"docusaurus-plugin-content-blog":{"default":{"blogSidebarTitle":"Recent posts","blogPosts":[],"blogListPaginated":[],"blogTags":{},"blogTagsListPath":"/blog/tags"}},"docusaurus-plugin-content-pages":{"default":[{"type":"jsx","permalink":"/","source":"@site/src/pages/index.js"}]},"docusaurus-plugin-debug":{},"docusaurus-plugin-svgr":{},"docusaurus-theme-classic":{},"docusaurus-bootstrap-plugin":{},"docusaurus-mdx-fallback-plugin":{}}}
